# digitsOCR
Handwrite digits recognition using KNN algorithms with training real time.

###Requirements:
- OpenCV 3.0
- Python 3

###How to use:
1. Start the program using command line "python3 ocrlearnKnn.py".
2. Write digits on a paper under the camera and check whether they are detected correctly.
3. Training your own hand writing data: first, press "x" button to pause the screen and the digits of its processing will show simultaneously; second, press "e" button and input the value of the digits with whitespace separated; then, press enter and the training data will be updated; finally, after many times of training, the program will detect your hand writing digits effectively.
